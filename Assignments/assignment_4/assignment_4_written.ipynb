    "\n",
    "A researcher in digital humanity studying narrative theory is trying to understand how the pace of the story (how fast or how slow the plots move across the story) impacts the success of the narrative. You can find their paper [here](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.2011695118). He randomly sampled a list of novels texts and measured their semantic speed (story pace) and popularity by the number of downloads (log transformed). Below is a subset of samples he collected:\n",
    "\n",
    "| index | speed | log_popularity |\n",
    "| --- | --- | --- |\n",
    "| 0 | 1 | 0 | \n",
    "| 1 | 0  |  1  |\n",
    "| 2 | 2  |  1  |\n",
    "| 3 | 2  |  2  |\n",
    "| 4 | 1  |  2 |\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, he wants to run a simple linear regression model to test the linear relationship between story speed, denoted as $X_i$, and its log popularity, denoted as $Y_i$. To conduct this regression analysis, answer the following questions. \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write down the regression model specification with regression intercept $\\beta_0$ and regression slope $\\beta_1$.\n",
    "2. Calculate the means for both variables $\\bar{X}$ and $\\bar{Y}$\n",
    "3. Compute the OLS estiamtes of regression slope $\\hat{\\beta_1} = \\frac{\\sum (X_i-\\bar{X})(Y_i-\\bar{Y})}{\\sum (X_i-\\bar{X})^2}$ and regression intercept $\\hat{\\beta_0} = \\bar{Y}-\\hat{\\beta_1}\\bar{X}$\n",
    "4. Compute the residuals $e_i = Y_i - \\hat{Y} = Y_i - \\hat{\\beta_0}-\\hat{\\beta_1}X_i$\n",
    "5. Compute sum of squared errors $SSE = \\sum e_i^2$, and what is the degree of freedom of $SSE$?\n",
    "6. Compute the mean squared errors $MSE = \\frac{SSE}{df(SSE)}$\n",
    "7. Compute the standard error of OLS estimates of regression slopes $s.e.(\\hat{\\beta_1}) = \\sqrt{MSE \\frac{1}{\\sum (X_i-\\bar{X})^2}}$ and regression intercept $s.e.(\\hat{\\beta_0}) = \\sqrt{MSE (\\frac{1}{n} +\\frac{\\bar{X}^2}{\\sum (X_i-\\bar{X})^2})}$\n",
    "8. The researcher wants to conduct a two-tailed $t$ test on the relationship between speed and popularity. State the null hypothesis and alternative hypothesis. Think: should we test on regression intercept or regression slope?\n",
    "9. Compute the $T$ statistic $T = \\frac{\\hat{\\beta_1}}{s.e.(\\beta_1)}$, what is the degree of freedom for this $T$ statistic?\n",
    "10. Write down the Python code to compute the $p$ value.\n",

    "    Recall the python code for two tailed t test, if $T$ statistic is positive, is\n",

    "    print(p)\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "12. The researcher also wants to conduct a $F$ test on the regression model. State the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis.\n",
    "13. Compute $SSTO = \\sum (Y_i-\\bar{Y})^2$, $SSR = SSTO - SSE$, and $MSR = \\frac{SSR}{df(SSR)}$\n",
    "14. Compute the $F$ statistic $F = \\frac{MSR}{MSE}$, what is the degree of freedom of this $F$ statistic?\n",

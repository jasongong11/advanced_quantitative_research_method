    "A researcher wants to investigate whether the type of persuasive technique used influences people's decision to agree with a donation to the church. The study involves 200 participants, divided based on whether they agreed or disagreed after being exposed to one of three persuasive techniques: Emotional Appeal, Logical Argument, or Social Proof. The observed frequencies are as follows\n",

## Acknowledgment
This course is developed from several statistical courses I have taken at UC, Davis and University of Illinois, Urbana Champaign. 

These courses are remarkably great, allowing me to learn the foundamental knowledge about statistics from a novice.

I hereby appreciate my instructors in these courses and their developed course materials, and highly recommend these courses to students who have an opportunity.
